This Repository Dotfiles contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my Linux and mac OS experience.

# symlinks

Some of the config for specific apps is set in this repo. I.e. warp theme set with hard symlink.

```
ln /Users/jakubszwajka/DEV/cheat-sheets/warp/themes/{theme}.yaml {theme}.yaml
```
